  ## API Reference

  ### Filtered Responses Endpoint

  **GET** `/:formId/filteredResponses`

  Fetches form responses with the option to apply custom filters.

  #### Query Parameters

    - **status** (string): The status of the form submissions to filter by.
    - **beforeDate** (string): Upper date limit for submissions in ISO format.
    - **afterDate** (string): Lower date limit for submissions in ISO format.
    - **filter** (string): Comma-separated strings for each filter. Format: `id,condition,value`.
    - **sort** (string): Sorting criteria for the responses.
    - **limit** (string): Number of responses per page (for pagination).
    - **offset** (string): Starting point for pagination.
    - **includeEditLink** (boolean): Flag to include edit link in responses.

  #### Filter Format and Usage

  The `filter` parameter accepts comma-separated strings, each representing a filter clause in the format `id,condition,value`. It supports multiple filter clauses, each provided as a separate `filter` query parameter.

    - **id** (string): The ID of the question to apply the filter on.
    - **condition** (string): The condition for filtering (equals, does_not_equal, greater_than, less_than).
    - **value** (string | number): The value to compare against the question's answer.

  #### Example

  ```http
  GET /cLZojxk94ous/filteredResponses/v1/api/forms/cLZojxk94ous/filteredResponses?filter=dSRAe3hygqVwTpPK69p5td,less_than,2024-04-01&filter=bE2Bo4cGUv49cjnqZ4UnkW,equals,Johnny
  ```

  This request fetches responses for form ID `cLZojxk94ous` where the answer to the question with ID `id1` equals `Timmy` and the answer to the question with ID `id2` is less than `2024-01-01`.



#### Filtering Behavior

- If no filter is included, all submissions for the specified form are returned.

- The API filters submissions to include only those containing the specified question IDs.
- Each submission is then further filtered to ensure it matches all provided filter criteria.
- A submission is included in the final response only if it meets all filter conditions for the specified question IDs.
